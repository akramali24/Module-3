=>OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming) are two different programming paradigms with distinct approaches to organizing and structuring code.

1.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Key Concepts:

   Objects: The fundamental building blocks in OOP are objects, which encapsulate data and behavior.
   
   Classes: Objects are instances of classes, which define a blueprint or template for creating objects.

   Encapsulation: It involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
   
   Inheritance: It allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reusability.

   Polymorphism: It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, enabling flexibility in code design.

   Example Languages: Java, C++, Python, and C# are examples of languages that support OOP.


2.Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP):

 Key Concepts:

  Procedures or Functions: In POP, the program is organized as a set of procedures or functions, which are sequences of instructions.
 
  Data: Data is typically organized in structures like arrays or records, and functions operate on this data.
 
  Top-Down Approach: The program's structure follows a top-down approach, with a main procedure calling other procedures.
 
  Example Languages: C, Pascal, and Fortran are examples of languages that follow a procedural paradigm.
